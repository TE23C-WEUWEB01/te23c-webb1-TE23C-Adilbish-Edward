    <h1>You got the silver</h1>
    <h2>Sångtexten</h2>
    <p>Hey babe, what's in your eyes?<br>
        I saw them flashing like airplane lights<br>
        You fill my cup, babe, that's for sure<br>
        I must come back for a little more</p>
    <p>You got my heart, you got my soul<br>
        You got the silver, you got the gold<br>
        You got the diamonds from the mine<br>
        Well, that's all right, it'll buy some time</p>
    <p>Tell me, honey, what will I do<br>
        When I'm hungry and thirsty, too?<br>
        Feeling foolish and that's for sure<br>
        Just waiting here at your kitchen door</p>
    <p>Hey baby, what's in your eyes?<br>
        Is that the diamonds from the mine?<br>
        What's that laughing in your smile?<br>
        I don't care, no, I don't care</p>
    <p>Oh, babe, you got my soul<br>
        You got the silver, you got the gold<br>
        A flash of love, just made me blind<br>
        I don't care, no, that's no big surprise</p>

    <p>The Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London in 1962. Active across seven decades, they are one of the most popular and enduring bands of the rock era. In the early 1960s, the band pioneered the gritty, rhythmically driven sound that came to define hard rock. Their first stable line-up consisted of vocalist Mick Jagger, guitarist Keith Richards, multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones, bassist Bill Wyman, and drummer Charlie Watts. During their early years, Jones was the primary leader. Andrew Loog Oldham became their manager in 1963 and encouraged them to write their own songs. The Jagger–Richards partnership became the band's primary songwriting and creative force.</p>
    <p>Rooted in blues and early rock and roll, the Rolling Stones started out playing covers and were at the forefront of the British Invasion in 1964, becoming identified with the youthful counterculture of the 1960s. They then found greater success with their own material, as "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction", "Get Off of My Cloud" (both 1965), and "Paint It Black" (1966) became international number-one hits. Aftermath (1966), their first entirely original album, is often considered to be the most important of their early albums. In 1967, they had the double-sided hit "Ruby Tuesday"/"Let's Spend the Night Together" and experimented with psychedelic rock on Their Satanic Majesties Request. By the end of the 1960s, they had returned to their rhythm and blues-based rock sound, with hit singles "Jumpin' Jack Flash" (1968) and "Honky Tonk Women" (1969), and albums Beggars Banquet (1968), featuring "Sympathy for the Devil" and "Street Fighting Man", and Let It Bleed (1969), featuring "You Can't Always Get What You Want" and "Gimme Shelter".</p>
